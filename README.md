# MIT Kerberos KDC for developing and testing Apache Ozone

[ozone-testkrb5](https://github.com/apache/ozone-docker-testkrb5) is used as KDC for testing Apache Ozone with Kerberos enabled.

Published only to [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/ozone-docker-testkrb5/pkgs/container/ozone-testkrb5), because it is completely insecure, and should be used only for testing, **not for production**.
